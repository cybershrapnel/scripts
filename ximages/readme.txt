Run the python file to post the images the javascript file produces
Run the javascript from console to produce the images the python script posts.
make sure to install dependencies.

pip install playwright
python -m playwright install

I used default chromium.

Just log into your desired account and it should do the rest automatically. Posts every 5 minutes. makes 50 images every 2 hours. So it gets about 12-13 images backed up every hour meaning there should always be images to post.

added a v2 script that has more prompting options.

added a make video script that takes your posted images and makes a video with a song every 15 minutes and posts to a community.

fyi, the chromium script uses chromium, it can not upload video but can upload images. the makevideo script uses firefox and it can upload video.
